# Parsing text in Scala using Attoparsec

This is the code and slides for my presentation at the Chicago Area
Scala Enthusiasts (CASE) meeting on 3/20/2014.

Much of the talk will involve looking at code in an editor and
experimenting with parsers using the REPL.  The slides are mostly
intended for off-line reference and they are admitedly quite ugly.

None of the code in here is intended for real production use.  It's
just the baseline for examples and discussion.
